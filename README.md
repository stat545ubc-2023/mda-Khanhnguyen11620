# STAT 545: Mini Data Analysis Project 1 

**___About this project___**

This repository is for Mini Data Analysis Project 1 for STAT 545 which is made by Khanh Nguyen. This is an individual data analysis project. There are several datasets for you to look at and choose one of them to further explore and analyze. There are four goals for this project: 

1. Become familiar with your dataset of choosing
2. Select 4 questions that you would like to answer with your data
3. Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown
4. Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing your data in tibbles using `dplyr`, with a research question in mind.

**___Files in the GitHub repository___**

There are three folders 
1. Milestone 1 includes:
   - mini-project-1-Khanh Nguyen.Rmd: This document is for doing data analysis assignments. The Rmd file includes markdown          (content with simple text formatting) and R code chunks.
   - mini-project-1-Khanh Nguyen.md: This document is created when we click 'knit' in Rstudio, it will execute all of the R          code chunks and create a new markdown (. md) document which includes the R code and its output.
   - README.md: This document provides context and how-to instructions for the project

3. Milestone 2 includes:
   - mini-project-2-Khanh Nguyen.Rmd: This document is for doing data analysis assignments. The Rmd file includes markdown          (content with simple text formatting) and R code chunks.
   - mini-project-2-Khanh Nguyen.md: This document is created when we click 'knit' in Rstudio, it will execute all of the R          code chunks and create a new markdown (. md) document which includes the R code and its output.
   - README.md: This document provides context and how-to instructions for the project

4. Output includes:
   - Summary table (.csv) and model object(.rds) files of milestone 2. These were saved and exported by using write_csv() and       saveRDS(), respectively.
     
**___How to run the code in this repository___**
- Firstly, you can clone this repository into your GitHub and pull the project to R.
- Secondly, you need to install `datateachr` and `tidyverse` packages to do the project (there are instructions in the .Rmd file)
- After completing all the exercises in the project, you need to click 'knit' in Rstudio. It will execute all of the R code chunks and create a new markdown (. md) document which includes the R code and its output.
