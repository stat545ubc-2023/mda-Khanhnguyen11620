# STAT 545: Mini Data Analysis Project 1 

**___About this project___**

This repository is for Mini Data Analysis Project 1 for STAT 545 which is made by Khanh Nguyen. This is an individual data analysis project. There are several datasets for you to look at and choose one of them to further explore and analyze. There are four goals for this project: 

1. Become familiar with your dataset of choosing
2. Select 4 questions that you would like to answer with your data
3. Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown
4. Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing your data in tibbles using `dplyr`, with a research question in mind.
